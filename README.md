- Node filter
- Zoom level for clicking on a node (`nodeZoom`) is definable independently from the maximum zoom level 22
- Formatted Code
- Translation support - https://crowdin.com/project/meshviewer - Contact us for new languages
  - Currently available: en, de, fr & ru
- Grunt inline for some css and js - less requests
