## Contributing is welcome

Pull requests are welcome without the need of opening an issue. If you're unsure
about your feature or your implementation open an issue and discuss your
suggested changes. Meshviewer is a frontend application and the code needs to be
loaded fast and perform with many nodes and clients on slow mobile devices.
